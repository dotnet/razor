    <!-- Note: It is important BuildAnalyzers.sln builds first and does not allow building in parallel.
         Because projects in Razor.slnx (or Razor.Slim.slnf) have a project reference to Razor.Diagnostics.Analyzers
         that is treated as an analyzer, there can be file locking issues if Razor.Diagnostics.Analyzers isn't
         built before Razor.slnx. Setting "BuildInParallel" to "false" ensures that this solution will be fully
         built first. -->
