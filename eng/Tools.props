      This is here to workaround flakiness in the NuGet SDK resolver in MSBuild.
      Arcade will run a pre-restore for these packages. This works more consistently than the SDK resolution which uses global.json.
      Without this here, we see regular failures with 'error MSB4236: The SDK 'Yarn.MSBuild' specified could not be found.'
      Since this project is evaluated before .npmproj files are loaded, this should cause the package to end
      up in the NuGet cache ahead of time.

      This is not needed in source build.
