/// meaning object identity is maintained even when the contents have changed.
/// 
/// We need to be able to identify from the source generator if a given code document was modified or 
/// returned unchanged. Rather than implementing deep equality on the <see cref="RazorCodeDocument"/> 
/// which can get expensive when the <see cref="ItemCollection"/> is large, we instead use a wrapper class.
/// If the underlying document is unchanged we return the original wrapper class. If the underlying 
/// document is changed, we return a new instance of the wrapper.
