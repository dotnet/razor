// Razor's tests cross-compile to verify that it works on .NET Framework. Unfortunately they compile
// against types in the framework BCL which means types exclusive to .NET Core would result in compilation
// errors.
// Fixing this would require re-authoring tests to always include .NET Core ref assemblies, but that
// is a fairly tedious processes. Until this becomes a broader problem, we'll shim new framework types
// that need to be referenced in tests.
