### Note

This (and code in Rules) was pulled from the [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/8f983a2c12162e49af7a7f2eb7744d220859f42b/src/RazorSdk/Targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.DesignTime.targets). These files are for tooling to define specific design time behavior and thus should be owned by tooling. As of writing these are only used in VS Code.
