     * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
     * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
     *
     * ---
     * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
     *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
     *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
     *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
     *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
     *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
     *
     * ---
     * ### How to encode tokens
     *
     * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
     * ```
     *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
     *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
     *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
     * ```
     *
     * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
     * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
     * ```
     *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
     *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
     * ```
     *
     * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
     * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
     * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
     * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
     * ```
     *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
     *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
     *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
     * ```
     *
     * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
     * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
     * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
     * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
     * ```
     *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
     *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
     *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
     * ```
     *
     * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
     * ```
     *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
     *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
     * ```
     *
     * @see [SemanticTokensBuilder](#SemanticTokensBuilder) for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
     * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until VS Code decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
     * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
     */

    /**
     * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
     * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
     *
     * ---
     * ### How tokens change when the document changes
     *
     * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
     * ```
     *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
     *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
     * ```
     *
     * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
     * ```
     *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
     *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
     * ```
     * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
     * ```
     *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
     *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
     *
     *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
     * ```
     *
     * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
     * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.
