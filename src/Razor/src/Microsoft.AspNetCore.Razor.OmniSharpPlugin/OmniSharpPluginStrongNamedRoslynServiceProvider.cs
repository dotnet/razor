    // DefaultTagHelperResolver's factory in the strong named assembly because it's internal to Razor and can only be accessed in a strong named
    // assembly.
    //
    // We're also unable to directly load and discover Roslyn exports in the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Razor.Workspaces.dll due to mismatches in
    // MSBuild metadata dependencies. The expectations of the MSBuild that is loaded with OmniSharp doesn't understand the version that Razor
    // is compiled against. If we could there'd be no need for this class.
