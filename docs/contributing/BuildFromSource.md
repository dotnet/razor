# Build Razor Tooling from Source

Building Razor from source allows you to tweak and customize the Razor compiler and tooling experience for ASP.NET Core, and to contribute your improvements back to the project.

See <https://github.com/dotnet/razor/issues> for known issues and to track ongoing work.

## Clone the source code

For a new copy of the project, run:

```ps1
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/razor.git
```

## Install pre-requisites

### Windows

Building Razor on Windows requires:

- Windows 10, version 1803 or newer
- At least 10 GB of disk space and a good internet connection (our build scripts download a lot of tools and dependencies)
- Git. <https://git-scm.org>

### macOS/Linux

Building Razor on macOS or Linux requires:

- If using macOS, you need macOS Sierra or newer.
- If using Linux, you need a machine with all .NET Core Linux prerequisites: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites>
- At least 10 GB of disk space and a good internet connection (our build scripts download a lot of tools and dependencies)
- curl <https://curl.haxx.se> or Wget <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget>
- Git <https://git-scm.org>

**NOTE** some ISPs have been know to use web filtering software that has caused issues with git repository cloning, if you experience issues cloning this repo please review <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/using-ssh-over-the-https-port>

## Building in Visual Studio

Before opening the `Razor.sln` file in Visual Studio or VS Code, you need to perform the following actions.

1. Executing the following on command-line:

   ```ps1
   .\restore.cmd
   ```

   This will download the required tools and build the entire repository once.

   > :bulb: Pro tip: you will also want to run this command after pulling large sets of changes. On the main
   > branch, we regularly update the versions of .NET Core SDK required to build the repo.
   > You will need to restart Visual Studio every time we update the .NET Core SDK.
   > To allow executing the setup script, you may need to update the execution policy on your machine.
   > You can do so by running the `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` command
   > in PowerShell. For more information on execution policies, you can read the [execution policy docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy).

2. Use the `.\startvs.cmd Razor.sln` script to open Visual Studio with the Razor solution. This script first sets the required
   environment variables. In addition, the following switches can be specified:

   - `-chooseVS`: When specified, displays a list of the installed Visual Studio instances and prompts to
     pick an instance to launch. By default, the newest recently installed instance of Visual Studio is
     launched.
   - `-includeRoslynDeps`: When specified, sets an environment variable that causes the Roslyn dependences
     of Razor to be deployed. This can be useful if the latest Razor bits depend on a breaking change in
     Roslyn that isn't available in the version of Visual Studio being targeted. If you encounter errors
     when debugging the Razor bits that you've built and deployed, setting this switch _might_ fix them.

3. Set `Microsoft.VisualStudio.RazorExtension` as the startup project.

### Common error: Unable to locate the .NET Core SDK

Executing `.\restore.cmd` or `.\build.cmd` may produce these errors:

> error : Unable to locate the .NET Core SDK. Check that it is installed and that the version specified in global.json (if any) matches the installed version.
> error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' specified could not be found.

In most cases, this is because the option _Use previews of the .NET Core SDK_ in VS2019 is not checked. Start Visual Studio, go to _Tools > Options_ and check _Use previews of the .NET Core SDK_ under _Environment > Preview Features_.

## Building with Visual Studio Code

Outside of Razor's language server and C# workspace logic, the bulk of our VS Code logic now lives in the [dotnet/vscode-csharp](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp) repo.

## Building on command-line

You can also build the entire project on command line with the `build.cmd`/`.sh` scripts.

On Windows:

```ps1
.\build.cmd
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Using `dotnet` on command line in this repo

Because we are using pre-release versions of .NET Core, you have to set a handful of environment variables
to make the .NET Core command line tool work well. You can set these environment variables like this

On Windows (requires PowerShell):

```ps1
# The extra dot at the beginning is required to 'dot source' this file into the right scope.

. .\activate.ps1
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source ./activate.sh
```

## Running tests on command-line

Tests are not run by default. Use the `-test` option to run tests in addition to building.

On Windows:

```ps1
.\build.cmd -test
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
./build.sh --test
```
